# BoneQuantMRI Matlab Application

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/180dedae-d275-4658-99d4-aa8081de3fb3)

## Purpose
This Matlab App supports the analysis of 31P and 1H signals from MRI scans. It allows users to:

1. Visualize images in 2D and 3D  
2. Segment images in 2D  
3. Apply local B1-correction  
4. Apply calibration curves to extract physical measurements  
5. Perform ROI-based processing  
6. Export modified images

The interface was tested with 64 × 64 × 64 images, but other dimensions should also work.

## Standalone App (No MATLAB license required)

A compiled version of the app is included:

```
deployment/Mac-AppleSilicon/output/package/installBoneQuantMRI.app
```

### Installation Steps:
1. Download the folder to your Mac (Apple Silicon).
2. Double-click `installBoneQuantMRI.app` and follow the installer instructions.
3. The installer includes the MATLAB Runtime.
4. Launch the app from your Applications folder like any other macOS app.

Tested on macOS Ventura (13.0) and newer.

## Quick Start 

1. **Data:** Load raw image and B1 correction image. The B1 image is downscaled automatically.
2. **Slice Browser:** View images in sagittal, coronal, or axial planes. Use the 3D button to view the result.
3. **Segmentation:** Manually adjust ROI for bone and phantom. Save/load masks.
4. **ROI Analysis:** Define trabecular and cortical regions. A third (growth plate) is inferred. Auto-segmentation uses Otsu's method.
5. **Results:** ROI types: Cortical, Trabecular, Growth Plate. Metrics: Volume, mean/median intensity (Tissue vs Bone).

## Detailed Instructions (using MATLAB)

### 1. MATLAB Installation
- Install MATLAB R2019a or newer: [MathWorks Trials](https://www.mathworks.com/campaigns/products/trials.html?prodcode=ML)

### 2. Launch App
- Open MATLAB → Use the Workspace Browser to open `MRI_Bone_Analysis.mlapp`
- App Designer opens → Press **Run**

### 3. Interface Overview
- The application window launches after pressing Run.

### 4. Data Import
- Use "Select DICOM for Raw image" and "Select DICOM for B1 image"

### 5. Visualization
- Use Slice Browser controls
- Display options (colormap, enhanced contrast) in **Data Processing** tab
- Turn off overlays for exporting images

### 6. 3D Rendering (not available in pre-compiled version)
- Use the 3D button for visualizing the final image
- MATLAB's `volumeViewer` is used under the hood

### 7. Segmentation
- Auto-segmented regions:
  - Green: specimen
  - Blue: phantom
  - Red/Black: holes
- Adjust threshold as needed (resets manual contours!)

### 8. Manual Re-Segmentation
- Press **Resegment** → Manual tool appears
- Draw ROI for phantom (blue) and bone (green)
- Use "New ROI" before each action

### 9. Navigation & Saving
- Navigate slices → Save to same folder as image
- Use Load button to reload masks

### 10. ROI-Based Processing
- Use sliders to define Cortical (C) and Trabecular (T) regions
- GPA region is auto-computed
- "Guess" estimates standard ROI sizes

### 11. Calibration
- Set reference density (e.g., 0.71)
- Choose 1-point or 2-point calibration modes
- Optionally set segmentation threshold (e.g., 4255)
- Enable/disable B1-correction

### 12. Results Table
- Use "Single" button to populate results
- Clicking a cell copies results to clipboard (paste in Excel)

### 13. Export
- Use Export menu to save calibrated images as 3D DICOM stacks

### 14. Automatic Mode
- Folder structure: `Run-1/Set-1/*.DCM`
- Do **not** select subfolders like `Set-1`
- Press "Auto" and select `Run-1`
- Ensure B1 file is preloaded

### 15. Result Parameters
- **TV**: Total Volume
- **BV**: Bone Volume
- **V_cort**: Cortical Volume
- **V_trab**: Trabecular Volume
- **Bone D.**: Mean Bone Density
- **Tissue D.**: Mean Tissue Density (Cortical, Trabecular, GPA)
- **Phantom / Noise**: Mean phantom or background values

## Modifications

Switch to **Code View** in App Designer to customize:
- Document changes in the program header
- Code sections:
  - **Properties** = Global variables
  - **Private functions** = Main logic (top-to-bottom workflow)
  - **Callbacks** = GUI component responses (ordered by creation)

## FAQ

**The app behaves unexpectedly / I see an error.**
- Check the MATLAB command window for detailed errors
- If reproducible, send bug report with steps and error to: `matthias.walle@gmail.com`

**How should my data be structured for automatic mode?**
```
Folder1/
  ├─ FolderA/*.DCM
  ├─ FolderB/*.DCM
  └─ FolderC/*.DCM
```
Do not select subfolders. Place all folders to process into one root folder.

**How can I export a screenshot of a slice?**
- Adjust settings in Slice Browser and Data Processing tab
- Use the export button in the corner of the image
- Or use the `.fig` button to open as MATLAB figure → Export

**Why do calibration phantoms look different across images?**
- MATLAB auto-adjusts grayscale contrast for display
- Use colormap or extract values from the results table to compare actual densities

## Compatibility
Tested from **MATLAB R2019a to R2025a**.
